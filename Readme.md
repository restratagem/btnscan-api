# BTNScan Public API Endpoints

Use the BTNScan Public API endpoints to fetch live on-chain data from the Bitnet network. Fair usage policy applies, and we reserve the right to close, alter, make unavailable, and reduce the rate limits on the given endpoints at our discretion and with no prior warning. Please use these endpoints at your own risk.

## Limits

Rate limits for public usage varies depending on the API servers availability and current usage. The expected average rate limit for most endpoins is of **1 Call Per 15 Seconds** or **4 Calls Per Minute** or **5,760 Calls Per Day**. Security tokens are used for private and enterprise API plans and have higher limits than the public free plan.
